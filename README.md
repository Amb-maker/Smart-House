# 🏠 Smart House System using OOP (Python Project)

This is a Python-based smart house simulation project using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
It includes basic smart devices like lights, fans, air conditioners, and a security system — all controlled and tracked by a central smart home system.

---

## 📌 Features

- Turn ON/OFF devices (Light, Fan, AC)
- Set temperature for Air Conditioner
- Activate/Deactivate Security System
- Add devices dynamically to the Smart Home
- Display status of all devices in the system

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OOP principles (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `smart_house.py`
2. Open terminal or command prompt
3. Run the program using:

```bash
python smart_house.py
Sample Output
Living Room Light is now ON.
